Project Title: Traffic Detection and Tracking

Overview

This project uses YOLOv8 to detect and track traffic-related objects (e.g., person, bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat, traffic light, fire hydrant, stop sign, parking meter, etc.) in videos. It includes scripts for extracting frames from videos, organizing the dataset, and training a custom YOLOv8 model.

Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TrafficDetection.git
cd TrafficDetection


	2.	Install Dependencies

pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy pandas torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib labelImg


	3.	Download YOLOv8 Model
The repository already contains yolov8n.pt or you can download from Ultralytics.

Dataset Preparation
	1.	Extract Frames
	•	Run frame-generation.py to extract frames from your videos.
	•	Frames will be saved in datasets/dataset/images/all.
	2.	Annotation
	•	Use LabelImg to label your images.
	•	Save annotations in YOLO format (.txt files) alongside each image.
	3.	Organize Dataset
	•	Run organize-dataset.py to split images and labels into train and val folders.
	4.	Update data.yaml
	•	Ensure train and val paths are correct and list the classes in names:.

Training
	1.	Run YOLOv8 Training

yolo train data=data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640


	2.	Monitor
	•	Logs and checkpoints appear in runs/detect/<run_name>.

Inference & Tracking
	1.	Open TrafficDetection.ipynb
	•	Adjust paths (e.g., input_video, output_video).
	•	Run all cells to perform detection and tracking on a video.
	2.	Results
	•	The processed video with bounding boxes will be saved in result/ or your specified output path.
	•	A CSV file (e.g., vehicle_counts.csv) may be generated with counts of detected vehicles.

Usage Example
	1.	Extract Frames

python frame-generation.py


	2.	Label the Images (using LabelImg manually)
	3.	Organize Dataset

python organize-dataset.py


	4.	Train

yolo train data=data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640


	5.	Detect and Track
	•	In Jupyter, open TrafficDetection.ipynb and run the notebook.
